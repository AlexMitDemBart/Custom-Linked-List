# Custom Linked List

## Description
Custom implementation of the double linked list. The list has the following methods: <br/>

```java
public void add(T element)
public void addFirst(T element)
public void addLast(T element)
public void remove(T element)
public boolean contains(T element)
public int size()
```

The list implements the Iterable Interface. So you can use the foreach loop.

## How it works
The easiest way to unterstand how it works is to take a look into the code.<br/>
It's pretty much standard logic with pointers.

## But why?
Why do a double linked list? everyone should do. Understanding data structures is <br/>
an elementary part of programming. Beginners in particular can learn and recognize how things work by reprogramming.
